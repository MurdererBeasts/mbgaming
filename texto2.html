          <p class="style37"><span class="style5">- 1996 - The beginnings of the clan - Pirates - </span><br>
            <span class="style49">It can be said that it all started in mid-1996 with our founder, Paulo Figueiredo (ShadowBeast)
            and two other friends, Mário Carmona (Carmona) and Alexandre (Alex).<br>
            At a time when 28 and 33 kbps modems were the cutting edge technology in Internet connections,
            they created the Pirates team to play the game, Quake.<br>
            Three years later, in 1999, Paulo leaves Quake and decides with another co-worker, João (Jony),
            to &quot;embrace&quot; a new game and project: the Unreal Tournament a competition game between online players.</span></p>
          <p class="style37"><span class="style5">- 2001 - The era of Unreal Tournament with LG (Limpeza Geral) -</span><br>
            <span class="style49">In March 2001 João leaves the clan and Paulo invites another co-worker, Rui Tavira (Intruderman)
            to his Unreal Tournament TDM team and both decide to change the name of the Pirates to
            LG (General Cleaning). In the following week, other 2 elements, AcidFire and Waveboard, joined the team.</span></p>
          <p class="style37"><span class="style5">- 2001 - The definitive Clan name MB (Murderer Beasts) -</span><br>
            <span class="style49">On June 2, 2001, Shadow decides to change the clan name General Cleaning to something related to his nickname ShadowBeast and with the help of Intruderman, the clan's final name, the MB (Murderer Beasts), is finally born.</span></p>
          <p class="style37"><span class="style5">- 2005 - Multigaming - MB Gaming - </span><br>
